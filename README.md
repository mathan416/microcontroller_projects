# projects
Various projects I've built and want to share for Arduino, Raspberry Pi and other projects.

picopong.py - For the Pico Pong code I modified for Raspberry Pi Pico and Unicorn Hat, I honestly cannot remember where I got the original code from and will most definitely annotate if I can find the original source!  I think it came from Pimoroni.  For a RaspberryPi Pico and Pimoroni Pico Unicorn Pack.

arduino_christmas.ino - Displays various animations and messages using an Arduino Uno and Nanopixel shiled.

christmas2022.py - Displays images with virtual snow using a RaspberryPi Pico and Pimoroni Pico Display Pack.

snowmessage.py - Displays virtual snow and a countdown timer using a RaspberryPi (Zero or Zero W preferred) and a Pimoroni Unicorn Hat Mini.
