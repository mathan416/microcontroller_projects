# projects
Various projects I've built and want to share for Arduino, Raspberry Pi and other projects.

For the Pico Pong code I modified for Raspberry Pi Pico and Unicorn Hat, I honestly cannot remember where I got the original code from and will most definitely annotate if I can find the original source!  I think it came from Pimoroni.
